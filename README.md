# Attender
This is an attendance management app for android for use by faculty.

This is my first complete application on android.

I have used sqlite database to store the database for the attendance offline.
We can login using our credentials and then we can create classes, enroll student with names and roll numbers. Once classes are done. We can see all the classes available and continue on taking attendance of all students which is stored. We can further see attendance of all students of a class and also complete record of a students like the dates he/she has been absent.
This provides all the options that should be available in an attendance application.
